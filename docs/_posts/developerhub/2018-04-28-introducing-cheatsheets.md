I have finally started a "[Cheat sheet](/developerhub/cheatsheet)" section on my website. Everyone likes Cheat sheets to deal with myriad of complexities of their tasks at hand, and as quick reminders to them. I too work with them, and I had a Git cheat sheet that I maintained for a long time. There are others which I created and lost! So I decided to use the power of my "Jekyll" powered website to maintain the cheat sheets as an articles - something that can be updated as and when required.

I've added the Git cheat sheet for now, and will add more as I write them. I hope they will be useful!
