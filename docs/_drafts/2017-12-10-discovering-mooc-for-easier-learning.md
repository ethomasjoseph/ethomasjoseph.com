After a very long stretch of busy work schedules, I was off work and used it to rejuvenate, introspect, and put myself into routine. And one of the target was to get started with learning a course from my learning plan. Over the long weekend of Thanksgiving and some earlier weekends, I managed to complete the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/mindshift/home/welcome" target="blank">Mindshift</a> course from Coursera, is when I started to formally put a learning plan for me, and it also when I was introduced to the term MOOC - even though I ve known Coursera for some time now

When learning Machine learning, I needed to brush up Linear Algebra. I do not have any of the texts so I "Binged" around for some text. Everything was dry and boring. Now I have a new way of learning - MOOC style. So I searched around for MOOC for Linear Algebra, and I landed up in a course from Khan's Academy.

Massive Open Online Course - commonly called MOOC (pronounced “mooks”) getting a popular medium of learning. I is changing the taste of learners and the medium of delivering content.
Enables learning for any one with internet connection.
From university courses, informal courses, cookery, startup, to courses to help in K12 subjects.
Not just simple videos, but more engaging, where the participant can access his knowledge with assignments and tests. Can also interact with fellow learners. Start and end dates - has timelines to follow. When completed gives the sense of achievement. For some, you can opt to pay for getting credits or certificates.
Even though it does not replace traditional way of learing (you can not personally interact with professor/teacher , or with other learners - form study groups etc)
MOOCs can be used to enhance skills for professionals. Learning for fun. As a medium of complement your traditional learning.
