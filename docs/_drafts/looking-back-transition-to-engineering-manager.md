What are the important ideas to be communicated?
1. Change of focus from programming and research to managing delivery. Client communication, solving business problem and timelines than programming problem.
2. Typical day as a Manager, Selective Ignorance.
3. Need to have more people onsite
4. How do I maintain the engineering edge - blogging, Coursera, open sourcing & GitHub,  

Official promotion

Start of managing teams -- managing tracks

shift of focus after official promotion
- old timers recalling the code that i have written in past

To code or not?


Maintaining the engineering edge
- how it is done
- why it is advantageous
- points from coursera blog
- selective ignorance

How things can be better?
- Hiring right people - even within project
- Coaching the team to a quality
- Give the team a

PoV on having more people onsite
- how offshore with lot of people around vs onsite primarily dealing with clients and hardly any larger execution teams
- hiring more people onsite makes sense
-- engineers will have more client's context
