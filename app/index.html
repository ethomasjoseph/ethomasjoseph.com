Passionate about building great software systems. Intrigued by creativity, challenges, strategy, and good conversations. I build applications and websites for my clients. I spend my spare time learning about emerging technologies for building great software systems and creating a better world.</p> <p>This website is re-incarnated with a new and fresh look - all built while learning every technology and technique used. Experiencing everything from making wireframes, to coding static HTML, to eventually making it through the <strong><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll (CMS)</a></strong>, which powers this website. The website is proudly hosted on <strong><a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Pages</a></strong>. Apart from topics relating to my profession, this website will also be home to some musings and thoughts on some of my other interests.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="row text-center"> <div class="text-center mx-auto"> <a href="/about" class="btn btn-lg btn-primary">Learn more</a> <a href="/developerhub/blog" class="btn btn-lg btn-outline-primary">Read DeveloperHub Blogs</a> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="container"> <div class="row"> {% include themes/{{ site.JB.theme }}/fragments/col-promo-card.html entries=site.posts limit=10 %} </div> </div>
